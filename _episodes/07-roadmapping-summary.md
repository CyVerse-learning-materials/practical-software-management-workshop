Participants will work in small teams to develop learning roadmaps to be implemented post-workshop (How will the workshop change what they are now doing? What questions do they still have? What technologies would the like more information on? etc.). These will be shared and collected and the instructional team will leave additional feedback and suggestions on the maps during and shortly after the workshop.
