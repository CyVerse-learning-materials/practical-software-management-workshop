### GitHub is an online version control tool
GitHub is an online service, owned by the Microsoft Corporation, that provides useful features for software developers and documentation creators to keep track of their files.

GitHub lets users create repositories which act like a folder on your computer that is used to keep files in a hierarchical file-and-folder system.

The underlying software that makes GitHub work is Git.

Git is a Decentralised Concurrent Versioning System, or DCVS. Simply put, the git computer program lets users keep track of the changes in their files. This process of tracking changes is called version control.

We will not be learning about the git command line software in this lesson - this is covered by the Software Carpentry lessons.

Instead we will be exploring the use of GitHub, without knowing any git commands, to set up repositories so that you can start to share code and documentation with others. 

### Creating a GitHub account
To start using GitHub, you will need to create a new user account.


If you already have a GitHub account, then please log in to GitHub by visiting the login page.

> ## Signing up to GitHub
> Open your web browser and go to <https://github.com>:
> - Click "Sign Up To GitHub"
> - Fill in the required information, i.e. a memorable username, a valid email address, and a strong password
> - If you do not pick a strong password, GitHub will ask you to supply a stronger one
> - GitHub may also ask you to solve a puzzle or CATCHPA to verify that you are a real human
> - Once verified, click "Next: Select A Plan"
> - Choose the free plan ($0 USD) by clicking "Choose Free"
